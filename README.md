# FlashCards CLI

#### A Learning Game For Those of Us That Miss The 80's

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 3/25/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Technologies Used

* `javaScript`

## Goals and Objectives

* Contribution to partially constructed object oriented app
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code for optimum *SRP*
* Implement test vigorous testing suite using TDD
* Create a running app using `CLI`

## Overview

* Do you miss the 80's?  Do you like to study abstract ES6 and play games. I have just the thing for you. A study flashcards game run entirely on the terminal line. This project drives home the practice of `TDD` to build out errorless class to class interaction.

## Set-up

* Clone this repo to your local computer
* If you would like to view code, open in your text editor
* Read the README.md
* To run the app, on the terminal line, run the command `node index.js`

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `Round-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.

---

## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` directory and the `test` directory.
